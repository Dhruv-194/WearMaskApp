# WearMaskApp  

In the present COVID times when it is necessary for us to live and quarantine at our homes we most often than not forget to wear our mask whenver we go out to buy something or to meet someone or for some other thing.

If something like this happens with you then worry not because this app will cater to your need of forgetting to wear a mask.


>## This App is basically a reminder app which helps you to remember to wear a mask whenever you go out. 


## So how does it work? 

Well the solution is very simple. 

In the 21st century where we are overly dependent on internet and we are continously on the internet almost always online be it through wifi or mobile data. 

So by using a very simple logic of network connection and disconnection this app works. As soon as you leave your house that you get disconnected from the internet then a notification will be sent to your phone which will then vibrate your phone and remind you to wear a mask. 


As our all new social experiences includes a mask which is now a necessity, then making an app for it will definitely enhance our community capabilities and social experiences.
